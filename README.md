This is a simple To-Do List app with a localStorage-based saving system and some UI libraries for styling and interaction.
I’m building it as a part of my future portfolio website — each of these small projects will serve as an interactive showcase.
Eventually, I plan to refactor it using TypeScript.

Technologies used in this project:

-React,
-Vite,
-Ant Design (UI components)
-Perticles(background animation)
